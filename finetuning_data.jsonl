Moreover, a lot of the new features would make use of generative AI as well as machine learning. This would assist in saving so many people\u0092s time.For starters, Photoshop has its own latest Selection Brush Tool. This would assist certain area selections by simply placing the brush across them. Moreover, you no longer have to go and use the Quick Mask initiative to do so. Meanwhile, users can also attain featured edges with the latest settings for adjusting opaqueness and hardness to get the best finishing.Adobe\u0092s Adjustment Brush Tool was in beta for a while now but today, it\u0092s also available. This enables painting to be done across any adjustments for better saturation, brightness, and more. There\u0092s a wide range of fine-tuning options to avail. At the same time. Adobe confirmed how the much anticipated generate image text to image feature is up for grabs after being in beta. So now, users can produce so many ideas through a simple text prompt or reference picture.Meanwhile, other features worth mentioning include an enhanced Contextual Task Bar. similarly, Adobe boasts about greater support for lists and even more options for rolling out enhanced details and Generative Fills.All in all, Adobe Illustrator has a new Generative Shape Fill option for filling up shapes having details and color. In this way, users combine hue and style together to produce several editable graphic options which can also be scaled.Text prompts would be used for filling up vector graphics for options such as Generative Shape Fill. Meanwhile, some features also include greater style designs like geometrics, 3D, and pixel art.The latest Text to Pattern offering on Illustrator makes it so much easier to produce, edit, and even scale various vector patterns. Any vector graphic produced through this means saying hello to crispier images with fancy UI controls that give enhanced options for editing.Another cool rollout would be the Mockup feature where a designer could see creations across objects such as product packaging and clothing. This simply adjusts the art piece so it fits easier on the object\u0092s edges.There\u0092s another Dimension tool for sizing with greater precision and also a wide selection of capabilities featuring faster pan speeds. Clearly, Adobe is on a roll this time around as creators are given so much to play with.All the latest set of offerings are going to be up for grabs on the latest variant of the Illustrator app and also for Photoshop across desktops.
